# Themes
1. Personal Themes:
     - These are use on a daily and is regularly updated with new stuff. There are 2 personal themes I use, one for my laptop and the other for my pc
     - My laptop theme has basic changes as I mainly mess around with snippets. So I stuff in that file is what I drive when not testing.
     - My PC theme on the other hand is for a vertical layout and has features that make use of the vertical space. Each module is labelled and is future proofed to make sure that classes don't break.
  

2. Rest of the themes:

  - ### AMOLED-Cord Theme:
My fiest attempt at making a theme. Was a fork of the AMOLED theme from betterdiscord theme page so I could have a foundation to go from and learn.

  - ### Bad Whatsapp:
Attempted to recreate whatsapp in discord... it is half baked and not good. Don't use it
    
  - ### Classic Discord
Attempted to recreate the classic look for discord. Needs a massive update due to classes changing

  - ### Modifed Dark Mode
Modified version of a different theme by LuckFire from betterdiscord themes. 

  - ### Simple Dark Mode
A simplied version of the modified dark mode

  - ### customTheme
My own custom theme that is a combo of what I've learned from the Modifed dark mode and AMOLED-Cord

  - ### discolored Theme
Doesn't work. Imports other themes but they're outdated

  - ### rounded
Extreme break down of discord elements and rounds them. Makes elements feel loose and spacey. Great for testing effects on specific spaces or to have a more _rounded_ experience

  - ### Stream Theme
Fork of maenDisease steam discord theme

  - ### XP Theme
Fork of Saltssaumure Windows XP discord theme
